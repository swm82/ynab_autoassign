## Description
Python script to automatically assign amounts to categories in YNAB by hitting YNAB API

## Use Case
After each paycheck, I budget for half the amount of all my bills.  It takes some of the guesswork out of budgeting.  I kept a spreadsheet of the amounts and every two weeks I'd go through and manually move money into the bills categories.  This script automates that process to save a few minutes, and avoid mistake.

## TODO
- Add a `--setup` arg to build the input file dynamically
